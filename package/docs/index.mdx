# How Shnippet Works

Shnippet keeps your docs and code samples aligned by extracting live snippets from your tests (or any source files you choose), formatting them for reuse, and exposing a lightweight runtime API you can call directly inside your documentation site.

## 1. Mark the Source Code

Add snippet boundaries to the parts of your codebase you want to publish. Shnippet will extract everything between `:snippet-start:` and `:snippet-end:` and normalize indentation for you.

```typescript math.test.ts
describe('Math functions', () => {
  it('should add numbers', () => {
    // :snippet-start: add
    const result = add(2, 3);
    // result is 5
    // :snippet-end:
    expect(result).toBe(5);
  });
});
```

## 2. Generate Snippet Assets

Run the Shnippet CLI (or the programmatic API) to scan your project. The extractor writes language-specific `.snippet.txt` files alongside generated TypeScript definitions so you can consume snippet names safely.

```bash
pnpm shnippet
```

The output looks like:

```text
package/snippets/
  gen-types/
    index.d.ts
  ts/
    add.snippet.txt
  py/
    add.snippet.txt
```

## 3. Fetch Snippets in the Browser

Inside your docs site, hydrate the Shnippet runtime with the same configuration you used during extraction. Then request snippets by nameâ€”the client returns a `SnippetResult` containing the available languages, default language, and raw snippet strings.

```tsx
import { snippetManager } from 'shnippet';
import type { SnippetName } from '../snippets/gen-types';

snippetManager.updateConfig({
  baseUrl: '/snippets',
  fileExtensions: ['ts', 'py', 'kt'],
});

const result = await snippetManager.getSnippet('add' as SnippetName);
```

## 4. Render the Snippet in React (or Any UI)

Once you have a `SnippetResult`, you can pass the content to your favorite code viewer component. Below is a simple example using Mintlify's `<CodeBlock />` component, but the same approach works with any renderer.

```tsx
import type { SnippetResult } from 'shnippet';
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

export function SnippetInReact({ result }: { result: SnippetResult }) {
  return (
    <CodeBlock language={result.defaultLanguage}>
      {result.content[result.defaultLanguage]}
    </CodeBlock>
  );
}
```
